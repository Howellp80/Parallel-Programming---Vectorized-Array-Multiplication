There are many problems in scientific and engineering computing where you want to multiply arrays
of numbers.
This project is in two parts. The first part is to test array multiplication, SIMD and non-SIMD. The
second part is to test array multiplication and reduction, SIMD and non-SIMD.

The files "simd.p5.cpp" and "simd.p5.h" were both provided by our professor.

To run:
copy the included files to your directory
execute the program with: 
$ python script.py
results are saved to output.txt
